# MR26

From http://machomeautomation.com/doku.php/supported_hardware/mr26

The proper serial port settings when setting up these devices are:
* 9600 baud
* 8 data bits
* 1 stop bit
* CTS/RCS selected as flow control

The MR26 was the first direct to the computer wireless X10 receiver. Prior to this all wireless devices had to be passed onto the powerline with a plugin X10 receiver.

* Receives X10 wireless commands (remotes and motion sensors) only, no security device support.
* The MR26 is a serial device and so requires a USB Serial adaptor.
* Since it's a serial device you can connect as many as necessary to extend the range or coverage.
* The included antenna is generally poor, but if you have some modest soldering skills you can replace it with a coax connector and use a real antenna to greatly improve reception. Instructions for doing so can be found on the shed.com homepage here
* The MR26 supports Ethernet/serial adaptors from Wiznet or Barionet and probably others.
